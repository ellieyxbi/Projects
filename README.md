Stock Data Analysis - Python  
Used static webscraping to obtain and organize stock data from Yahoo Finance. Visualized price changes, volume changes, and cumulative monthly return percentages. Designed an investment strategy to determine whether all-in investment or dollar-cost averaging would produce the largest percent return.

Model Building & Analysis - RStudio  
Imported data on countries, explored and refined the data through residual analysis and transformations. Used model building methods - forward, backward, and exhaustive - to determine which predictors best fit a linear model for Life Expectancy. Refined the model using AIC methods.

Non-Parametric Testing - RStudio  
Used non-parametric tests to test for differences in one-sample, two-sample, and k-sample data. Compared the conclusions of non-parametric tests to conclusions in parametric tests. Tests used: Binomial Test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, Permutation Test (mean & deviance), Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test
