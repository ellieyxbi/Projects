# Projects

Stock Data Analysis - Python  
Used static webscraping to obtain and organize stock data from Yahoo Finance. Visualized price changes, volume changes, and cumulative monthly return percentages. Designed an investment strategy to determine whether all-in investment or dollar-cost averaging would produce the largest percent return.

Model Building & Analysis - R  
Imported data on countries, explored and refined the data through residual analysis and transformations. Used model building methods - forward, backward, and exhaustive - to determine which predictors best fit a linear model for Life Expectancy. Refined the model using AIC methods.

Non-Parametric Testing - R  
Used non-parametric tests to test for differences in one-sample, two-sample, and k-sample data. Compared the conclusions of non-parametric tests to conclusions in parametric tests. Tests used: Binomial Test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, Permutation Test (mean & deviance), Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test

Diabetes Predictor - Python
Collaborated with a team to create a diabetes prediction tool. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed machine learning models including gradient boosting, random forest, XGBoost, neural networks, and logistic regression. Selected XGBoost as the final model for deployment. Built a local webpage to accept user inputs and predict diabetes outcomes.

Predictive Modeling of Neural Acitivty in Mice - R
Used the Steinmetz dataset on neural activity to explore the relationship between neural firing patterns and decision-making success in mice. Conducted EDA, data integration, and predictive modeling with machine learning algorithms. Focused on time bins of neural activity to identify those most informative for predicting decision outcomes, emphasizing their importance during the decision phase.

Asteroids Predictor - Python
Worked with a team to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous based on input features. Developed and evaluated models including decision trees and logistic regression to classify potentially hazardous asteroids effectively.
